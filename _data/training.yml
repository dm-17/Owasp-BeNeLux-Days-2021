            Seba (<a href="https://twitter.com/Sebadele">https://twitter.com/Sebadele</a>)  is co-founder, CTO of Toreon and a proponent of application security as a holistic endeavor. He started the Belgian OWASP chapter, was a member of the OWASP Foundation Board and performed several public presentations on Application Security. Seba also co-organized the yearly security & hacker BruCON conference and trainings in Belgium.<br />
            With a background in development and many years of experience in security, he has trained countless developers to create software more securely. He has led OWASP projects such as OWASP SAMM, thereby truly making the world a little bit safer. Now he is adapting application security models to the evolving field of DevOps and is also focused on bringing Threat Modeling to a wider audience.

  abstract: >-
            Building security into the software development and management practices of an organisation can be a daunting task. There are many factors that must be considered when charting your path forward, inlcuding&#58; company structure, stakeholder priorities, technology stacks, tools and processes, and existing technical debt.<br />
            <br />
            Implementing software assurance can produce significant benefits for the organisation. However, trying to achieve this without a good framework often yields only marginal and unsustainable improvements. OWASP SAMM (<a href="https://owaspsamm.org/">https://owaspsamm.org/</a>) provides exactly the structured, measurable framework that's needed. It enables you to formulate and implement a strategy for software security tailored to your organisation's risk profile.<br />
            <br />
            This one-day training is organised as a mix of presentations and interactive workshops. Our goal is for participants to get an in-depth view of, and practical feel for, the OWASP SAMM model. The session is organised in three parts&#58;<br />
            <ul>
            <li>First, we present an overview of the model and review the similarities and differences with other models. The five Business Functions - Governance, Design, Implementation, Verification, and Operations - are explained. We address the various constituent elements (e.g., metrics), review representative usage scenarios for the model, and defining an assessment's scope.</li>
            <li>The majority of our day will be spent reviewing the Security Practices comprising each Business Function, with an emphasis on assessing your organisation's maturity. Each Practice's treatment will include a hands-on segment, providing you an opportunity to apply SAMM to your organisation (or one you have worked for). We will assess representative Activities across all SAMM Practices, discussing our results and concerns in the group. This will give participants a good indication of their organisationsâ€™ maturity in software assurance. In the same effort, we will define a target model for your organisation and identify the most important challenges in getting there.</li>
            <li>The final part of the training will be dedicated to specific questions or challenges that you are facing about secure development in your organisation. In this group discussion, experiences will be shared among participants to address these questions.</li>
            </ul>
            If you've been struggling to launch a secure software initiative in your organisation, this training should provide you with the necessary foundations and ideas to do so.<br />

  title   : SKF Workshop - Offensive and Defensive crash course using SKF Labs
  abstract: >-
            Practice-changing impact, long lasting security knowledge and skills -- are the expected outcomes of this new-school webapp security training. This is a training with minimum lectures and all focused on hands-on exercises. We start off with some understanding of secure development and the secure coding principles. Then we do basic hacking challenges and move gradually to the advanced topics, but after that we do exercises that are about fixing vulnerable code. The attendees will have after this course a vast set of actionable knowledge and practise to be used straight away.<br /> 
            <br />
            Below is the main agenda overview that will be used as a structure but we will, based on the audience, select other topics of interest that we will do on this training day.<br />
